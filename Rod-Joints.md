# Rod Joints
Basically, rod elements are imported in the same exact way as 2-node beams.  A
3D straight line is created and hooked to the two objects associated with the
two [MBDyn][1] nodes the joint connects.

Please refer to the relevant portion of the page describing the import of
[beams][2] for more details.
