# PUMA full main rotor model

In this tutorial will be animating a full aeroelastic model of the main rotor of an
[AÃ©rospatiale SA 330 Puma][1] helicopter. The full model of the PUMA is
available through the MBDyn website [here][2] (scroll down to the "Applications"
section), while the model that we will be using is distributed with the
**Blendyn** add-on, in the `tests/puma_rotor` directory of the repository.

## Simulate the model and locate the results file
The main input file for the model is called `puma-4blade-elastic`.
As was the case in the [helicopter blade analysis tutorial][5], the NetCDF
output is enabled by activating the related option in the `control data`
section of the input file

```
begin: control data;
	...
	output results: netcdf;
 end: control data;
```

Again, this is not strictly necessary, but let's say highly recommended: 
it speeds up considerably the loading of the [MBDyn][3] output, and it 
enables plotting of variables directly in [Blender][4].

As shown in the other tutorials, after you have simulated the model, you want
to import first the `.nc` or `.mov` file, and then the `.log` file, in order
to give the add-on all the necessary information about the [MBDyn][3] model 
structure. 

## Import nodes and elements
Switch to the Scene Property panel and scroll down until you see the [MBDyn][3] 
nodes and elements lists. Click on the `Add nodes to scene` button to import all
the nodes as empty axes. You should get something similar to what is shown in the
following picture
- - -
[![MBDyn nodes imported as empties][empties]][empties]
- - -
By selecting `Individual Origins` as the Pivot centers for scaling and rotation,
pressing `S` and dragging the mouse, the dimensions of the empties axes can be
reduced. 

OK, so now we have the first hint that we're dealing with an helicopter rotor.

In the [MBDyn][3] model, the blades are modeled with `beam3` elements, to take 
into account their deformation. We can import all the `beam3` elements at once
by going to the Scene Properties Panel, scrolling down to the [MBDyn][3] element
list, select `beam3` in the `Elements to import` drop-down menu, inserting a random
big number in the `last element to import` field and click on `Import elements
by type` button. The result is shown in the following picture
- - - 
[![MBDyn beams imported as NURBS curves][beams]][beams]
- - - 
The beam elements have been imported as NURBS curves, as explained in 
[helicopter blade analysis tutorial][5] and in the [wiki page][6] about the import
of beams. 

The plain axes empties are auxiliary objects used in the animation of `beam3` elements
that can be hidden by manually selecting them in the Scene Outline and pressing `H` or by
clicking on the small eye found next to their names. You can also use some very simple
python commands to do so from the python console:
```
for obj in D.objects:
	if 'M1' in obj.name:
		obj.hide = True
```
and repeating that for the second set of auxiliary objects:
```
for obj in D.objects:
	if 'M2' in obj.name:
		obj.hide = True
```

The same procedure can be used to import the four `rod` elements representing
the pitch links.  This time, as explained in the [wiki page][7] on the rod
joints import, the deformable elements are represented as straight 3D lines in
space.
- - -
[![MBDyn beams imported as NURBS curves][rods]][rods]
- - -

The model's base structure is already evident: if you'd so like, you can animate
the scene by pressing on `Animate scene` in the Tool Panel. The output of the
simulation consists in 2501 steps, that can take quite a bit of time to load. 
Setting the frequency to something around 10 (i.e. to animate one frame every 
10 simulated steps) will result in a manageable number of frames. 
If you want to output the final result in a video file, keep in mind that you should 
instead select a frequency according to the framerate of the movie. 
Standard framerates are 24, 25 or 29.97 fps, so (considering that the final time 
of the simulation is 4.5 seconds), you should set the frequency to 
`2501/(4.5*24) = 23`, `2501/(4.5*25) = 22` or `2501/(4.5*29.97)` = 18, respectively.

## 'Dressing up' the model
Ok so now it is time to *dress up* the model, to make it look a bit more like an
helicopter rotor :)

### Blade airfoil profile
First of all, let's grab a suitable profile for the blades. Head to
[Airfoiltools][8] and click on *NACA 5 digit airfoils* on the left sidebar.
Scroll down and download the *Selig format dat file* for the *NACA 23012 12%*
arifoil. Save the file in the blender model folder (actually, you can save it
wherever you like, but we like to keep things tidy, here).

Then, you want to select all the beam curves. You can head to the Group
Outliner, as shown in the following picture, and click on all the curve icons
next to the name of the beam groups, holding the `SHIFT` key:
- - -
[![Beam groups in Groups Outliner][beams_groups]][beams_groups]
- - -
or you could use some Python trickery again. First, deselect all by pressing `A`
(possibly, more than once). Then, head to the Python console and type
```
for obj in D.objects:
    if 'beam' in obj.name and 'M' not in obj.name:
        obj.select = True
```
Now press the `Load profile (Selig)` button in the Data Properties panel:
- - -
[![The load Selig profile operator in Data Panel][load_selig]][load_selig]
- - -
and locate the *NACA 23012* Selig-formatted file you saved before. The profile
is automatically assigned as a bevel shape for all the selected beam curves. You
should have something similar to what is shown in the next picture
- - -
[![NACA23012 profile assigned to the beam3 curves][beams_profiles_1]][beams_profiles_1]
- - -

The profile curve is placed on the first empty layer: in this case, layer 2. We
want to scale it down to the correct dimensions and move the origin of blender
reference frame of the curve object to the correct position. 
If you have taken your time to take a peek in the [MBDyn][3] model files, you
might have noticed that the parameters for the aerodynamics of the rotor blades
are written in the `blade.set` file, in particular at line 44:
```
44 set: const real blade_chord     = 0.537;        # m
```
we want to scale the profile to have that length. Since profiles loaded in Selig
format have unit cord length, we want to scale the shape uniformly by a
factor `0.537`. Just select the curve and enter `0.537` in the Scale fields (all of
them) in the Transform Panel. 

Then, we want to move the origin of the axes attached to the section to a
quarter of the chord length: in the Location fields of the Transform Panel place
`-0.25*0.537` in the x direction, to move the profile to the left of that
quantity. Now make sure that the cursor is in the origin (for example with
`Shift + S` -> `Cursor to Center`), press `Shift + Alt + Ctrl + C` and select
`Origin to 3D Cursor`. You should now have something similar to what is shown in
the screenshot below
- - -
[![NACA23012 profile scaled and placed in the correct position][beams_profiles_2]][beams_profiles_2]
- - -

Now, moving back to layer 1, the blades should now look a lot more realistic. To
add a little bit more of realism, let's add a taper profile to the beams closer
to the root of the blade. 

Switch to layer 3 and create a NURBS curve with the parameters shown in the next
screenshot
- - -
[![Taper profile for blade roots][taper]][taper]
- - -
You can define your own shape at will. What worked for me are the following `(X,
Y)` coordinates for the four points (named progressively from left to right): 
```
1 (0.0, 0.35)
2 (0.35, 0.35)
3 (0.6, 1.0)
4 (1.0, 1.0)
```
You may want to rename the object you just created to something more telling,
like `BladeTaper` or something similar.

Select, one at a time, the blade root beams (the objects named `beam3_
11400`, `beam3_12400`, `beam3_13400`, `beam3_14400`) and select the NURBS curve
you just created as a taper object. You should have something similar to the
screenshot below
- - - 
[![Taper profile applied to root blade beams][taper_applied]][taper_applied]
- - - 
Now select the tip beams' objects (objects names `beam3_11406`, `beam3_12406`,
`beam3_13406`, `beam3_14406`) and select the `Fill Caps` option, to *close* the
blade tips with a solid face. The checkbox is also located in the Geometry
Panel.

### Pitch links sections
For the pitch links, we want a very simple bevel curve: a circle of diameter `2
cm`. Select layer 4, add a circle and give it Size `0.02` in all
directions. Now select it as the bevel objects for the pitch links' rods
(objects `rodj_11400`, `rodj_12400`, `rodj_13400`, `rodj_14400`) and select as a
bevel object for each the circle you have just created.

### Rotor Head
In the `tests/puma_rotor/cad` directory of the repository, a full CAD 3D model
of the PUMA rotor head is provided. Well, actually the model provided is that of
a *PUMA-like* rotor head, since both geometry and dimensions, aside from the
ones that really matter for the purposed of matching with the [MBDyn][3] model,
are arbitrarily guessed... Anyway, it will serve our purposes fine!

You can also find the CAD assembly on [Onshape][onshape] at [this link][onshape_puma]: 
you are free to copy, share, export and build upon the model under the terms of the 
[CC Share Alike licence][CCPL].

- - -
[![Rotor head CAD assembly][cad]][cad]
- - -
The tags in the figure reflect the name of the `.stl` files the CAD assembly has
been split into, each containing the geometry of a component represented in the
[MBDyn][3] model by a node.

#### Swashplate rotating disc
Let's start by loading in [Blender][4] the `swashplate.stl` file. Go to
`File`->`Import...`->`Stl (.stl)` and locate the file. After the import,
[Blender][4] will automatically select the file. The default units in the `.stl`
files are millimiters, while the [MBDyn][3] models uses meters, so we have to
scale the mesh by a factor `0.001`. Press `S` and type `0.001`, then press
`Return` to do so. 

Another thing that we want to do is to place the local axes of the swashplate
mesh in the correct position. By going into Edit Mode (hitting `TAB`), you can
notice that the origin of the mesh geometry is already in the correct location,
while by returning into Object mode (again hitting `TAB`) you'll notice that the
origin of the Object is not. Simply hit `Shift + Alt + Ctrl + C` and select
`Origin to Geometry` to fix the local axes origin. Hit `R`, then `X` and type
`-90` and press return to fix also the axes orientation, placing the `Z` axis
upward. Hit `Ctrl + A` and then select `Rotation` to apply the rotation,
re-defining the reference orientation of the Object.

The node representing the rotating swashplate is node `10300`: you can work it
out by looking at the `set` statements in files `puma.set`, `hub.nod` and
`puma-4blade-elastic`, or just watching at the central part of the rotor, moving
between frames of the animated [Blender][4] model. We want to place the
swashplate Object in the same location and with the same orientation of the
Empty representing its node: select it by clicking on the object named
`node_10300` in the Scene Outline. Hit `Shift + S` and select `Cursor to
Selected` to move the cursor in the origin of the node's Empty Axes. Then select
the swashplate Object, hit again `Shift + S` and select `Selection to Cursor`.

Next, rotate the swashplate Object about its `Z`-axis (by pressing `R` and then
`Z`) to align it: place the pitch links approximately in the center of their
joint sections, for now.

- - -
[![Swashplate mesh object correcly positioned][swashplate]][swashplate]
- - -
#### Lag hinges
Let's now focus on the lag hinge: import the `lag_hinge.stl` file and scale the
mesh as before. Hit `Shit + Alt + Ctrl + C` and select `Origin to Geometry`:
also in this case, this is all you need to do to place the local axes in the
correct position.

Now, to align the local axes with respect to the [MBDyn][3] node, rotate the
mesh by `90Â°` about the `X`-axis and by `180Â°` about the `Z`-axis to get the
mesh in the orientation shown in the screenshot:
- - - 
[![Lag hinge mesh object][lag_hinge]][lag_hinge]
- - - 
Apply the rotation by pressing `Ctrl + A` and selecting `Rotation`.

Select the first lag hinge node Empty Object, which is `node_11100`, press
`Shift + S`, select `Cursor to Selection`. Then select the lag hinge mesh, press
again `Shift + S` and this time select `Selection to Cursor`. This way, you will
have moved the lag hinge mesh in the correct position. 

Now double check that you have only the lag hinge Object selected and hit `Shift + D`
to duplicate it. Select the second lag hinge node Empty Object `node_12100`, hit
`Shift + S`, select `Cursor to Selection`... You got it: just repeat the process
to position also the second lag hinge Object. To align it, apply a rotation
about the `Z`-axis of `90Â°`, to match the orientation of the `node_12100`
Object. 

Repeat the process for the other two lag hinges, and you'll what is shown in the
following screenshot
- - -
[![All 4 lag hinge meshes in the correct positions][lag_hinges]][lag_hinges]
- - - 

All is left to do is to assign the correct parenting: select the lag hinge
object first, the node Object second holding `Shift` (this way, the node Object
will be the active Object) and then press `Ctrl + P` and select `Object` to set
the parenting. In the outline, the parenting will be reflected by the mesh
object being moved under the node Object in the tree.

So for example for the first lag hinge, after you have selected the mesh Object,
hold `Shift` and select the `node_11200` object. Move the cursor to the 3D View
and hit `Ctrl + P` and select `Object`. Repeat the process with the others lag
hinges.

#### Flap hinges
Import the `flap_hinge.stl` file, scale it and tab into Edit Mode: we want to
place the local reference frame in the middle of the *fork*, on the axis passing
though the centers of the cilindrical sections that protrude at each side. To do
so, let's first place the reference frame where the central vertex of the
outside faces of the cylinders is (look at the next image):
- - -
[![Flap hinge object preparation][flap_hinge_1]][flap_hinge_1]
- - -
Then do the usual procedure to align it with the first flap hinge node Empty
Object `node_11200`: select the `node_11200` Object, hit `Shift + S` and click
on `Cursor to Selected`, then select the `flap hinge` object, hit again `Shift +
S` and select `Selection to Cursor`. You'll get to this configuration:
- - - 
[![Flap hinge object preparation][flap_hinge_2]][flap_hinge_2]
- - -
Click on the `Y`-axis of the flap hinge Object (the green arrow) and drag it to
place it in the correct position. If you did not move the Cursor in the process,
directly press `Shift + Alt + Ctrl + C` and select `Origin to 3D Cursor`. If you
happened to move the Cursor, first place it back in the `node_11200` origin by
selecting the Object and, as usual, pressing `Shift + S` and selecting `Cursor
to Selection`, then proceed to move the origin of the flap hinge Object. 
- - - 
[![Flap hinge object preparation][flap_hinge_3]][flap_hinge_3]
- - - 
Duplicate the flap hinge mesh and repeat the process, aligning all the meshes to
the nodes' Empties. Assign the parenting as you've done for the lag hinges. 

#### Pitch hinge
As you did before, load the `pitch_hinge.stl` file, scale it down by a factor
`0.001`, hit `Shift + Alt + Ctrl + C` and select `Origin to Geometry`, place the
mesh in the same location of the `node_11400` Object and rotate it to match the
node orientation. You'll get to this configuration:
- - - 
[![Pitch hinge object preparation][pitch_hinge]][pitch_hinge]
- - - 
You just have to move the mesh by dragging the red arrow to align the sections
of the flap hinge and the flap hinge. Also make sure that the pitch link joint
is correcly aligned with the pitch link rod! As done for the other hinges,
duplicate the object, place them in the correct positions and assign the
parenting to the `node_11400`, `node_12400`, `node_13400` and `node_14400`
Objects. 

We have completed the positioning and parenting of the rotor hinges: you should
have something similar to this:
- - - 
[![Rotor hinges in place][hinges]][hinges]
- - - 

#### Rotor hub
The last piece that we have to place and parent is the hub mesh, that you can
find in the `hub.stl` file. The node that represents this rigid body is
`node_10300`. The procedure is the same as the swashplate and the hinges meshes:
import the file, scale it, move the local axes to the Geometry axes, rotate it
to have the `Z` axis pointing upward, select the `node_10300` Object, move the
cursor to its origin, then move the `hub` Object to the cursor. You should have
to then move the mesh along the `Z` axis and rotate it about the same axis to
mate it with the hinges and swashplate meshes: you'll find the correct position
by matching the lag hinges with their seatings and the compass ball joints and
their seatings. Don't forget to parent the `swashplate` Object to the `node_10300`
Empty Axes Object and the `hub` Object to the `node_10100`
Empty Axes Object, and you should get to something similar to this:
- - -
[![Rotor head full assembly][rotor_head]][rotor_head]
- - -
... And that's it! The model is ready to be animated! Best of things, it won't
require any other adjustment as you go through different simulations: as long as
you don't rename the nodes in the [MBDyn][3] input files, you can just load a
new result file and animate the [Blender][4] scene again!

### Renders
Just some images (and soon animations): I simply added some materials to the
bladed and the rotor head assembly, some lights and a camera, and rendered the
result. Send me a request [here](mailto:andrea.zanoni@polimi.it) if you're
interested and I'll share the final .blend file.
